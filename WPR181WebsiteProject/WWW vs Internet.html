      <li>One of the differences between the two is that the internet funtions<br> as a transport mechanism,
        whiles the World Wide Web application uses those transport functions.<br>The World Wide Web is a system of universally
        accepted standards for storing,<br> retrieving, formatting and displaying infofrmation through a client/server architecture. 
      </li>
      <li>The Web handles all types of digital information, which includes text, hypermedia,
        graphics and sound.
      </li>
      <li>It also has hypertext as the underlying concept which defines the structure of the World Wide Web.</li>
      <li>Hypertext is the text displayed on a computer display or on other electronic device with references, which are called hyperlinks, to other text that the reader can immediately access, or where text can be revealed progressively at additional levels of detail.</li>
      <li>This is just a common point of connectivity for information sharing which is facilitated by a global network of computers.</li>
      <li>The web uses the internet to pass over information.</li>

    <section class ="internet" id="textbackground"><h2>Internet</h2>

    <ol>
      <li >The internet is a global WAN which connects approximately 1 million organizational computer networks in 
        more than 200 countries.</li>
      <li>The backbone of the internet is a fibre-optic network which is operated primarily by large telecommunications companies.</li>
      <li>This is a connection between computers and countless other devices that form a huge network of systems.</li>
      <li>This is a massive public network of networks, a web of hardwired and wireless connections between disparate 
        drives on countless
         devices scattered around the world. It is sort of a global computer, where each individual 
        computer or server becomes another node in a massive, distributed system.</li>
