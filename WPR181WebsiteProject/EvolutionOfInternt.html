                     <h2>Web 1.0</h2>
                     <p id="p">Web 1.0, also known as the static web, was the first form in which users could interact with hypertext over the internet. The static web was a read-only web where businesses could upload purely text-based information and users could access these pages and were restricted to only being able to read them. There was little to no interaction on this web. These web pages made use of purely html so the only thing that could be updated was the text. The main purpose of this web was to publish information that people across the world could access.</p>

                     <h2>Web 2.0</h2>
                     <p id="p">Web 2.0, also known as the social web, was only introduced in 2004 and brought about the first form of interactivity on web pages. This meant that users were able to read information published by companies/ other people, and they themselves could write on these pages. The other features of web 2.0 that were introduced are as follows: flexible web design, creative reuse to form new websites, more regular updates,  and collaborative content creation. The introduction of collaborative content creation brought about the formation of blogs, which was a major milestone as users could comment on published information and could essentially communicate with other users across the globe.</p>

                     <h2>Web 3.0</h2>
                     <p id="p">Web 3.0, also known as the sematic web, was introduced in 2006 and is the current web phase we are in. The purpose of the sematic web is to link, integrate, and analyse data from various data sets to obtain new information streams. This means it can improve data management, support accessibility of mobile internet so devices such as cell phones can access the information on the web,  simulate creativity and innovation, encourage factor of globalization phenomena, enhance customersâ€™ satisfaction, and help to organize collaboration in social web.</p>

                     <h2>Web 4.0</h2>
                     <p id="p">Web 4.0, often referred to as the "Intelligent Web," represents the next phase in the evolution of the internet. Building upon the foundations of Web 3.0, it focuses on seamless integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning into every aspect of online interactions. This incarnation of the web envisions highly personalized and contextually aware user experiences, where virtual assistants anticipate needs, data is securely decentralized, and the boundaries between physical and digital realities blur through augmented and virtual reality technologies. Web 4.0 has the potential to revolutionize industries, enabling advanced automation, precise content recommendations, and unprecedented levels of connectivity.</p>
