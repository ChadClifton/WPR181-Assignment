            <div class="p2" id="textbackground">
                <p>In simple terms, The World Wide Web is a way of exchanging information between computers on the internet, which then ties them all together into a vast collection of interactive multimedia resources. The most basic definition of the World Wide Web is: all the resources and users on the Internet that are using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). It merges the techniques of networked information and hypertext to make an easy but powerful global information system. It represents any information accessible over the network as part of a seamless hypertext information space.</p>
            </div> 

            <p class="p22">It was originally developed to allow for information to be shared within international teams and the circulation of information by support groups. It was originally aimed at the High Energy Physics community but has now spread over to other areas and attracted interest in user support, resource discovery and collaborative work areas. It is also an architecture which will also embrace any future advances in technology, which includes new networks, protocols, object-types, and data formats.</p>

            <div class="p3" id="textbackground">
                <p>The World Wide Web is a system that interconnects hypermedia resources such as documents and images on the internet. This is done using something called hyperlinks, which are referenced by Uniform Resource Locator (URLs). The URLs are shown using web pages and websites.</p>
            </div>

            <p class="p33">The World Wide Web gives users access to a wide selection of mass media and content, that is connected by the means of hypertext or hypermedia links. The Hypertext allows the user to select a word or phrase from text and thereby access other documents that contain additional information pertaining to that word or phrase. Hypermedia documents feature links to images, sounds, animations, and movies.</p>

            <div class="p4" id="textbackground">
                <p>The World Wide Web operates within the Internetâ€™s basic client-server format. There is a browser software which allows users to view the retrieved documents.</p>

            </div>

            <p class="p44">The World Wide Web browsers can access many existing data systems through existing protocols (FTP, NNTP) or through HTTP and a gateway. Through this method the critical mass of data is quickly exceeded, and the increasing use of system by readers and information suppliers encourage each other.</p>

            <div class="p5" id="textbackground">
                <p>The development of the World Wide Web was begun by Tim Berners-Lee and his colleagues at CERN. They created a protocol called HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which standardized communication between servers and clients. It was only then made available for general release in January 1992.</p>
